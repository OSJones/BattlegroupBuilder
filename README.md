Army Builder for Battlegroup.

Battlegroup is a set of tabletop wargame rules for recreating the battles of World War II, with 20mm or 15mm miniatures.

The ruleset is written by Warwick Kinrade and published by Iron Fist Publishing and PSC Games

You will need a copy of the rulebook and one of the theatre supplements as this army builder doesn't show any stats or rules.
